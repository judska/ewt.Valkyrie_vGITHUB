		{"willysmb_chn" "Over a short period of time, three US companies -- Willys, Ford and Bantam -- worked together to develop a reliable and efficient off-roader to suit military needs. Production began in 1941, and it quickly proved its worth on the battlefield. Its excellent speed, and its capacity to mount large-calibre machine guns, made the Willys one of the finest army vehicles of WWII."}
		{"universal_carrier" "The Universal Carrier, also known as the Bren Gun Carrier from the light machine gun armament, is a common name describing a family of light armoured tracked vehicles built by Vickers-Armstrong and other companies.The Carrier, 3-inch Mortar was a design based on the 2 Pounder Carrier with a 3-inch mortar mounted in place of the 2 pounder. Designed to enable the mortar to have 360 degree traverse and to be fired either from the vehicle, or dismounted. 400 were produced and were ultimately sent as military aid to the Nationalist Chinese Army."}
		{"m3_chn" "This armored half-truck was produced by the US from 1941 onwards, and used as a transport vehicle for tank corps and artillery divisions. Some vehicles were delivered to USSR as part of a lend-lease program. The spacious hull was made open-top. Along with a compartment designed to take eight soldiers, it housed a large-calibre machinegun, with mounts for additional machineguns on the rear and sides. The M3 proved to be a fast and reliable vehicle, well-suited for use in the harsh conditions of war."}
		{"chevrolet" "Truck that comes with infantry ammo, mortar ammo and TNT."}
		{"chevrolet_art" "Truck that comes tank and artillery ammo."}
		{"chevrolet_eng" "Truck that comes with Sandbags, Barricades and Barbed Wire."}
		{"m17_stan" "A mounted Browning HMG used for infantry killing and suppression."}
		{"zpu-4" " A large AA gun that comes with four 14mm Autocannons, very useful for killing infantry and light vehicles."}
		{"pak_35_chn" ""The 37mm Pak 36(r) was a German anti-tank gun used by the Wehrmacht in World War II. Useful for killing light vehicles, but nothing else."}
		{"cannone4732_chn" "This very accurate medium Italian AT gun is capable of engaging enemy medoum tanks from the side, or from the front in close distance."}
		{"zis3_chn" "The ZIS-3 was the world's first conveyor-assembled artillery piece. It was highly praised by artillery specialists and, on February 12, 1942, it entered service with the Red Army. Firing armor-piercing rounds, it was able to penetrate 70mm of armor at medium range, while its high-explosive shells demonstrated high stopping power and a great damage radius."}
		{"type_97_150mm_chn" "The captured Japanese Type 97 150mm Mortar is a heavy emplacement capable of raining down 150mm shells. This weapon can quickly dispatch even the toughest of infantry, killing entire squads with a single shell, but retaining a solid rate of fire. This weaponry will shatter our enemies morale!"}
		{"ba-6" "Is an extremely fast, lightly armored vehice capable of firing 45mm shots. With an MG attached to it, this is the perfect vehicle for light rushes, but it will serve useless against enemy tanks."}
		{"bt_5_chn" "The BT tanks were a series of Soviet cavalry tanks produced in large numbers between 1932 and 1941. They were lightly armoured, but reasonably well-armed for their time, and had the best mobility of all contemporary tanks of the world. The BT tanks were known by the nickname Betka from the acronym, or its diminutive Betushka."}
		{"amr35-13mm_chn" "Is a small, light tank capable of firing 13mm rounds. Good for infantry supression, this vehicle is easily countered by a variety of enemy weapons."}
		{"sdkfz222a" "Production of these 4x4 light armored vehicles started in 1936. Thanks to its good ride performance, this vehicle became very popular among German troops and was widely used in the initial battles of World War II. An automatic gun installed on its small rotating turret, coupled with a 20mm machine gun, proved effective at striking enemy personnel and light armored equipment. However, the insufficient protection of the SdKfz 222 led to its being downgraded to reconnaissance and support equipment."}
		{"m5a1_chn" "Between 1941 and 1944, the American Car and Foundry and Cadillac's Car Division manufactured a huge number of these light tanks, which were to see action in the many theatres of World War II. They were supplied to Great Britain, the Soviet Union, France, China and Yugoslavia. These low-weight, small machines boasted relatively good protection, while the twin Cadillac automobile engines and automatic gearbox provided the tank with perfect ride performance. At the same time, a rather poor 37mm gun and insufficient protection prevented the Stuart from being a match for enemy medium and heavy equipment, relegating it to reconnaissance and direct infantry support missions."}
		{"m24_chn" "The M24 entered US Army service in the summer of 1944, replacing the M3 Stuart, which was quickly becoming obsolete. In terms of firepower and armor, the M24 surpassed all light tanks of WWII. Despite its 75mm gun being largely ineffective against medium and heavy tanks, its great mobility allowed the Chaffee to be successfully used in scouting and airborne missions."}
		{"m4a4_chn" "The Sherman entered mass production in 1942. Despite being the strongest US tank at the time, it could not compete with the German tanks, its high profile and weak armor, along with the poor performance of its main gun, contributed to the overall vulnerability of the tank. Nevertheless, thanks to its relatively low production cost, the Sherman functioned as the main battle tank of the Allies."}
		{"m18_chn" "This 18-ton Gun was remarkable for its excellent speed, and featured a powerful 76mm gun, capable of destroying almost all enemy vehicles. Its excellent mobility and low profile made the M18 a difficult target for enemy guns. However, due to insufficient armor, the vehicles were forced to fire from under cover. Hellcats were also armed with high-calibre anti-aircraft machine guns and were actively used by the U.S. army in Italy and North-western Europe."}
