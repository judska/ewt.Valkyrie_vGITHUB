In order to mount a powerful 85mm anti-tank gun, some changes had to be introduced into its turret design: it became larger and more heavily protected. Its side and rear armor was also enhanced, which, in combination with its sharp slope angle, significantly increased the shell resistance of the hull. As a result the T-34's weight increased to 32 tons, making the tank a bit slower, but its combat efficiency rose significantly."}
