Hotchkiss also advertised the 13.2 mm machine gun as an infantry weapon, that could be fitted on conventional tripods and be used against light armour. French infantry commanders, that had expressed interest in acquiring light anti-aircraft guns, refused the 13.2 mm. They argued that those heavy bullets falling down could be dangerous to friendly troops, and went to larger calibres where self-destructing shells were available.

By using welded armour plate instead of the dated riveted design of the D1 this would be lighter than a simple version of the D1 made with thicker plating. The Char D2 units fought tenaciously during the Battle of France, losing most of their tanks to mechanical breakdown instead of enemy action."}
                {"s35" "The SOMUA S35 was a French Cavalry tank of the Second World War. Built from 1936 until 1940 to equip the armoured divisions of the Cavalry, it was for its time a relatively agile medium-weight tank, superior in armour and armament to its French and foreign competitors, such as the contemporary versions of the German Panzerkampfwagen III. It was constructed from well-sloped, mainly cast, armour sections, that however made it expensive to produce and time-consuming to maintain.."}
                {"hero9_fra" "The AMX 50 (official designation) or AMX-50 was a French heavy tank designed in the immediate post Second World War period. It was proposed as, in succession, the French medium, heavy, and main battle tank and incorporated many advanced features. However, it was to suffer cancellation in the late 1950s due to unfavourable economic and political circumstances combined with delays in development. With a bit of immagination the French may have built this during ww2 had they not capitulated. With it's 120mm frontal armor and 120mm gun the AMX has the ability to ho toe to toe with Axis heavy tanks."}    
                {"arl44" "The ARL 44 clearly shows that it is based on earlier French heavy tank designs. The hull glacis plate is 120 mm thick and reclined at about 45°, giving a line-of-sight thickness in the horizontal plane of about 170 mm. This made the ARL 44 the most heavily armoured French tank until the Leclerc. With a 90mm revolver gun it should be a match for similar heavy tanks."}
                {"b1bis_3" "The Char B1 was a specialised heavy break-through vehicle, originally conceived as a self-propelled gun with a 75 mm howitzer in the hull; later a 47 mm gun in a turret was added, to allow it to function also as a Char de Bataille. Starting in the early twenties, its development and production were repeatedly delayed, resulting in a vehicle that was both technologically complex and expensive, and already obsolescent when real mass-production of a derived version, the Char B1 bis, started in the late thirties. Although a second uparmoured version, the Char B1 ter, was developed, only two prototypes were built."}
                {"lorraine_47" "A tank destroyer varient of Lorraine 37L APC, the Lorraine 37L ER was armed with a 47 mm SA 47 guns. With a relative fast speed and a decent gun, the Lorraine can be annoying AF."}
                {"b1bis_at" "Anti-tank variant of the Char B1 fitted with a 75mm. Only one was produced beofre production ceased on the B1 series."}
		{"gnome" "A light motocycle used for supporting infantry. Comes armed with a prominent machine gun, but is quickly taken down by entrenched enemies."}
		{"laffly_v15t" "This is a very fast jeeped aimed for shock attacks on enemy troops. Very fast and mobile, this jeep could be easily suppressed by strong enemy fortifications, so use it wisely."}
		{"hotchkiss_stan" "A Heavy MG used for infantry supression. While cheap and powerful, this MG is vulnerable to grenades or artillery."}
