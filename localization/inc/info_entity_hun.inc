To address this problem a number of foreign heavy artillery guns were adopted, including the Canon de 155 mm GPF. After the end of the war development work began in the United States on a design to improve upon the existing models of heavy gun and carriage. A number of prototypes were produced in the 1920s and 1930s, but the projects were put on hold due to lack of funds. In 1938 the 155 mm Gun T4 on Carriage T2 was finally adopted as 155 mm gun M1 on Carriage M1."}

Widespread production started in 1933, and it soon proved to be the best anti-aircraft weapon available, when Germany intervened during the Spanish Civil War. It also turned out to be an excellent anti-tank weapon, as its high muzzle velocity and large calibre gave it the power and range to take out enemy armor. The success of this weapon lead to many variants, and it was one of the most recognizable German weapons throughout the war."}

When the Germans faced Soviet tanks in 1941 during Operation Barbarossa, the PaK 38 was one of the few early guns capable of effectively penetrating the 45 mm armor of the formidable T-34. Additionally, the gun was also equipped with Panzergranate 40 APCR shots featuring a tungsten core, in an attempt to penetrate the armor of the heavier KV-1 tank. Although it was replaced by more powerful weapons, it remained a potent and useful weapon and remained in service with the Wehrmacht until the end of the war."}

		{"l335_hun" "The L3/35 or Carro Veloce CV-35 was an Italian tankette that saw combat before and during World War II. Although designated a light tank by the Italian Army, its turretless configuration, weight and firepower make it closer to contemporary tankettes. It was the most numerous Italian armored fighting vehicle and saw service almost everywhere the Italians fought in World War II but proved inadequate for modern warfare having too thin armor and weak armament of only machine guns. In 1935, a slightly improved model of the CV-33 was introduced and designated CV-35. The primary differences were that the armour was bolted rather than riveted and the single 6.5 mm machine gun was replaced with twin 8 mm machine guns. Many older CV-33s were retrofitted to meet the specifications of the CV-35. In 1938, the vehicles were redesignated L3/33 ('L' for Leggero or 'light') and the L3/35."}

The 75mm AT gun Pak 39 was mounted on the chassis of a Czech Lt38 light tank, which gave the vehicle good mobility. Compact dimensions, low profile and sloped frontal armour resulted in increased shell resistance, but at the same time had a negative impact on the amount of carried ordnance. Despite insufficient side protection, the Hetzer is widely considered to be one of the most successful vehicles in its class."}

Initially intended as a mobile, armoured light gun for infantry support, the StuG was continually modified and was widely employed as a tank destroyer.As the StuG III was designed to fill an infantry close support combat role, early models were fitted with a low-velocity 75 mm StuK 37 L/24 gun to destroy soft-skin targets and fortifications. After the Germans encountered the Soviet KV-1 and T-34 tanks, the StuG III was equipped with a high-velocity 75 mm StuK 40 L/43 main gun (Spring 1942) and later – the 75 mm StuK 40 L/48 (Autumn 1942) anti-tank gun.

The Weiss firm inspired itself many of the German model to develop its prototype, including the inclined armour of it. However the Hungarian TAS weighed 10 tons less about than the Panther, was equipped with a strong forward-mounted turret and a suspension with bogie with 6 double-road wheels on each side. The Hungarian firm worked on a tank destroyer version of armed with a 88 mm gun in casemate, an equivalent to the German Jagdpanther .
