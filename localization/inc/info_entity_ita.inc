Wheel plates were added to absorb more recoil energy and to help the gun cross soft ground. Despite these serious drawbacks it seems to have been produced in large numbers as some 895 were in Italian service on June 1940.

One innovative aspect of the design was the placement of the final reduction gears inside the front-mounted drive sprockets, eliminating the need for enlarged final drive housings in the bow armor.

Only 30 of these vehicles were produced, all in 1942.This low production was due to Italy's limited industrial capability at the time, as well as high demand for the 90 mm gun for regular anti-aircraft duties. The Semovente 90/53 was primarily developed in response to demands by Italian forces on the Eastern Front for a vehicle-mounted anti-tank weapon that could take on Soviet T-34 and KV tanks.
