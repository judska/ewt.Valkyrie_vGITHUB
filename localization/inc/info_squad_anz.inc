The vehicle was used widely by British Commonwealth forces during the Second World War. Universal Carriers were usually used for transporting personnel and equipment, mostly support weapons, or as machine gun platforms. With some 113,000 built by 1960 in the United Kingdom and abroad, it is the most produced armoured fighting vehicle in history."}
		{"hero2_anz" "The \"Volunteer Rifles\" the New Guinea Volunteer Rifles (NGVR) was an infantry battalion of the Australian Army. It was initially raised as a unit of the Militia from white Australian and European expatriates in New Guinea upon the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, before being activated for full-time service following the Japanese landings in early 1942. NGVR personnel then helped rescue survivors of Lark Force from Rabaul in February and March 1942. Between March and May, the NGVR monitored the Japanese bases which had been established in the Huon Gulf region, being the only Allied force in the area until the arrival of Kanga Force at Wau in May. The battalion subsequently established observation posts overlooking the main approaches and reported on Japanese movements."}
		{"hero3_anz" "The \"Jungle Gun\" is a converted Ordnance QF 13-pounder support gun modified to handel the rigors of the the jungle. The QF13 was developed as a response to combat experience gained in the Boer War and entered service in 1904, replacing the Ehrhard QF 15 pounder and BL 12 pounder 6 cwt. It was intended as a rapid-firing and highly-mobile yet reasonably powerful field gun for Royal Horse Artillery batteries supporting Cavalry brigades, which were expected to be engaged in mobile open warfare. It was developed in parallel with the QF 18-pounder used by field artillery."}
		{"hero4_anz" "The \"Desert Patrol\" car was an adapted M3 Scout Car used for raiding and quick response in desert warfare. Equipped with a forward faceing Browing .50 cal hmg and two Browing .30 cal lmg's you should use this to deliver quick strikes to unprepared defences and withdraw to cover should the enemy come with a counter."}
		{"hero5_anz" "The \"Desert Rats\" was an armoured division of the British Army that saw distinguished active service during World War II, where its exploits in the Western Desert Campaign made it famous as the Desert Rats. The division fought in most major battles during the North African Campaign; later it would land and fight in the Italian Campaign during the early stages of the invasion of Italy before being withdrawn to the United Kingdom where it prepared to fight in North-west Europe. It began landing in Normandy during the afternoon of D-Day, 6 June 1944, and fought its way across Europe ending the war in Kiel and Hamburg, Germany. The 7th Armoured Brigade was detached from the division during early 1942 and fought the Japanese during the fighting in the early stages of the Burma Campaign, it then returned to the Mediterranean Theatre and fought in the Italian theatre."}
		{"hero6_anz" "The \"40MM Bofors\" often referred to simply as the Bofors gun, is an anti-aircraft/multi-purpose autocannon designed in the 1930s by the Swedish arms manufacturer AB Bofors. It was one of the most popular medium-weight anti-aircraft systems during World War II, used by most of the western Allies as well as by the Axis powers. A small number of these weapons remain in service to this day, and saw action as late as the Gulf War."}
		{"hero7_anz" "The \"Staghound\" were two American armored car designs produced during the Second World War. Neither saw service with frontline US forces but the latter was supplied, via the United Kingdom, to British and Commonwealth forces during the war and received the service name Staghound. A number of countries used the Staghound after the war, with some of the vehicles continuing to serve into the 1980s. The Staghound was an innovative design that incorporated some advanced features. It had two rear-facing 6-cylinder engines with automatic transmissions with 4 forward and 1 reverse gears feeding through a transfer case to drive both axles. Either two- or four-wheel drive could be selected. Either engine could be shut down while in motion and taken out of the drive train. Additionally, a power steering pump was incorporated that could be switched on or off manually from the driver's instrument panel depending on steering conditions."}
		{"hero8_anz" "The \"4.2 inch Mortar Carrier\" is yet another adaption to the universal carrier. Fitted with a 4.2 inch mortar it allows both mobility and limited that a regular mortar simply doesn't have.  Universal Carriers were usually used for transporting personnel and equipment, mostly support weapons, or as machine gun platforms. With some 113,000 built by 1960 in the United Kingdom and abroad, it is the most produced armoured fighting vehicle in history."}
		{"hero9_anz" "The \"Radio Operator\" is a special trained infantryman capable of calling in precise artillery strikes with his signal flares. A trained artillery observer awaits in the rear, ready at a moments' notice to direct fire down onto any signals he sees. The Radio Operator's unique abilities make him valuable, and special care should be taken to keep him from harm."}
		{"hero10_anz" "The \"Staghound Tulip\" was used on only a handful of Canadian Staghounds in the late war period. The Staghound wore a pair of similar racks but with four 60 lbs. rockets, similar to the Sherman IC Tulip, but with two rails on each side. Like the Sherman tank, the conversion was tagged as Tulip. The Staghound Tulip served with the XII Manitoba Dragoons in France, 1944. The rockets were not especially accurate at long range, and at short range the fuze often failed to detonate the warhead. First Canadian Army recommended further study, but cancelled a February 1945."}
		{"hero11_anz" "The \"Sexton\" was a self-propelled artillery vehicle of the Second World War. It was based on Canadian-built versions of the American M3 Lee and M4 Sherman tank chassis, which entered production in Canada as the Ram and Grizzly. When Sherman production in the US expanded and supply was no longer a problem, in 1943 it was decided to switch the Canadian production lines to produce the Sexton to give the British Army a mobile artillery gun using their Ordnance QF 25 pounder gun-howitzer. This powerful gun can take out nearly any tank from max range, just remember you can be taken out in a similar way! "}
		{"hero12_anz" "The \"Churchill VCS\" was a Churchill equipped with a close support 95mm howitzer with 47 rounds in place of the main gun in a cast turret. The turret was similar, but not identical, to the Marks IV/VI turrets, with a slightly different opening for the gun in the turret front face. With imense armor and the ability to fire long ranged HE, use this to soak up anything the enemy throws at you while delivering a barrage of death on your opponents."}
