		{"tankman(fra)" "The effectiveness of a tank depends, first of all, on a crew's cohesion and its ability to act consistently in any situation. The most powerful and dangerous vehicle will become a pile of scrap metal if there's no crew to control it. When training a tank crew, interchangeability of all members is the key, because the tank must remain combat-ready, even if only one crew member survives. \n Although French tank crews are armed with government-issue weapons, they have no combat training and hence are extremely vulnerable."}
		{"home_guards2(fra)" "An  untrained civilian, armed with a standard-issue Fusil MAS mle 36 rifle. The rifle's long range makes it most effective over long and medium distances. However, due to the Fusil MAS mle 36 low-capacity cartridge and a comparatively low rate of fire, at close range those riflemen are easy targets for submachine gunners and assault infantry."}
		{"riflemans2(fra)" "A  French infantrymen armed with a few anti-personnel grenades and a Fusil MAS mle 36 rifle. These riflemen are most effective at long and medium ranges. In close combat, they become easy prey for enemy submachine gunners and assault squads."}
		{"smgs2(fra)" "French submachine gunners are armed with Mitraillette MAS mle 1938 submachine guns, anti-personnel and smoke grenades and incendiary mixtures. Effectively killing enemies at close and medium ranges, a submachine gunner can do well in both attack and defence of the most critical objectives."}
		{"mgs2(fra)" "A soldier armed with a Châtellerault modèle 1929 light machine gun can suppress enemy at long and medium ranges over a long period of time. Hidden in a firing position of made of sandbags, French machine gunners become nearly invincible to small arms, and gain significantly in firing accuracy and dispersion."}
		{"elite-rifle(fra)" "A Rifleman gunner which is armed with a Fusil MAS mle 36 rifle, anti-personnel, anti-tank  grenades. This Rifleman can be used in both defence and offence and can effectively fight enemy infantry at medium and high ranges."}
		{"elite-smg(fra)" "A Sub-machine gunner which is armed with Mitraillette MAS mle 1938 gun, anti-personnel, anti-tank and Molotov Coctails. This submachine gunner can be used in both defence and offence and can effectively fight enemy infantry at close and medium ranges."}
		{"elite-mg(fra)" "A Soldiers armed with Châtellerault modèle 1929 light machine gun can provide excellent fire support to friendly infantry on assault. The Châtellerault's low magazine capacity is made up for by its high rate of fire and killing power. In addition, when mounted on special supports to fire from under cover or from a prone position, its accuracy and density of fire is greatly improved."}
		{"ap_miners(fra)" "Anti-personnel minefields are intended to deny enemy personnel entry to deployment sites and are mainly placed in front of established positions or on the flanks. A group of four mine-laying soldiers, armed with submachine guns, is capable of quick deployment of minefields, thereby securing unoccupied or strategically important sectors."}
		{"at_miners(fra)" "Anti-tank minefields are primarily meant for securing troop deployment sites and are mainly placed in front of established positions and occasionally on the flanks. A group of four mine-laying specialists, armed with submachine guns, is capable of quickly deploying the obstacle line, thereby securing unoccupied or strategically important sectors."}
		{"sappers(fra)" "Using portable mine detectors, this two-man squad of skilled demolition specialists can quickly detect and clear any minefields. Disarmed mines may be picked up and reused. For front-line operations, the squad is armed with submachine guns and can offer some resistance. Nevertheless, it is not recommended that these specialists be sent to attack fortified enemy positions."}
		{"snipers(fra)" "Using his rifle, a sniper can eliminate enemy personnel from a safe distance and the mounted telescopic sight allows him to spot even the best-hidden enemy saboteurs. Camouflage is the sniper's main weapon which is why, in addition to a telescope-sighted rifle, he carries a throwing knife and several camouflaging bushes."}
		{"officers(fra)" "The presence of a seasoned officer on the battlefield can change the course of battle. Using field binoculars, he can spot enemy infantry and saboteurs hiding in bushes or long grass. An officer can also spot an enemy from a long distance allowing time to regroup and react. As well as binoculars, he carries a knife and a personal handgun. However, these weapons are not suited to a heated battle."}
		{"at_rifles(fra)" "This anti-tank infantrymen is equipped with an anti-tank rifle, perfectly suited for taking out lightly armored enemy vehicles. While the high velocity rifle packs a punch, it is insufficient to take on heavier vehicles and it may require several shots to fully disable light vehicles."}
		{"flamers(fra)" "A soldier armed with a flame-thrower can inflict heavy damage on infantry inside a building and can single-handedly clear an entire area of enemies. In spite of this, he is extremely vulnerable because once he has used up all of his flammable liquid he remains unarmed and a random bullet can cause an explosion if it hits his cylinder. Accordingly, a combat unit includes several escort submachine gunners."}
		{"radiomans(fra)" "The Radio Operator is a specially trained infantryman, capable of calling in precise artillery strikes with his signal flares. A trained artillery observer awaits in the rear, ready at a moments' notice to direct fire down onto any signals he sees. The Radio Operator's unique abilities make him valuable, and special care should be taken to keep him from harm."}
