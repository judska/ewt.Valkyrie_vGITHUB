		{"tankman(fra)" "The effectiveness of a tank depends, first of all, on a crew's cohesion and its ability to act consistently in any situation. The most powerful and dangerous vehicle will become a pile of scrap metal if there's no crew to control it. When training a tank crew, interchangeability of all members is the key, because the tank must remain combat-ready, even if only one crew member survives. \n Although French tank crews are armed with government-issue weapons, they have no combat training and hence are extremely vulnerable."}
		{"home_guards2(fra)" "An  untrained civilian, armed with a standard-issue Fusil MAS mle 36 rifle. The rifle's long range makes it most effective over long and medium distances. However, due to the Fusil MAS mle 36 low-capacity cartridge and a comparatively low rate of fire, at close range those riflemen are easy targets for submachine gunners and assault infantry."}
		{"riflemans2(fra)" "A  French infantrymen armed with a few anti-personnel grenades and a Fusil MAS mle 36 rifle. These riflemen are most effective at long and medium ranges. In close combat, they become easy prey for enemy submachine gunners and assault squads."}

		{"elite-mg(fra)" "A Soldiers armed with Châtellerault modèle 1929 light machine gun can provide excellent fire support to friendly infantry on assault. The Châtellerault's low magazine capacity is made up for by its high rate of fire and killing power.

		{"officers(fra)" "The presence of a seasoned officer on the battlefield can change the course of battle. Using field binoculars, he can spot enemy infantry and saboteurs hiding in bushes or long grass. An officer can also spot an enemy from a long distance allowing time to regroup and react.

		{"at_rifles(fra)" "This anti-tank infantrymen is equipped with an anti-tank rifle, perfectly suited for taking out lightly armored enemy vehicles.

Accordingly, a combat unit includes several escort submachine gunners."}
