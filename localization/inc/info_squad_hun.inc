		{"tankman(hun)" "The effectiveness of a tank depends, first of all, on a crew's cohesion and its ability to act consistently in any situation. The most powerful and dangerous vehicle will become a pile of scrap metal if there's no crew to control it. When training a tank crew, interchangeability of all members is the key, because the tank must remain combat-ready, even if only one crew member survives. \n Although Hungarian tank crews are armed with government-issue weapons, they have no combat training and hence are extremely vulnerable."}
		{"home_guards2(hun)" "An  untrained civilian, armed with a standard-issue Steyr Mannlicher M1895 rifle. The rifle's long range makes it most effective over long and medium distances. However, due to the Steyr Mannlicher M1895 low-capacity cartridge and a comparatively low rate of fire, at close range those riflemen are easy targets for submachine gunners and assault infantry."}

		{"smgs2(hun)" "Hungarian submachine gunners are armed with Danuvia 39M submachine guns, anti-personnel and smoke grenades and incendiary mixtures. Effectively killing enemies at close and medium ranges, a submachine gunner can do well in both attack and defence of the most critical objectives."}
		{"mgs2(hun)" "A soldier armed with a MG-13 light machine gun can suppress enemy at long and medium ranges over a long period of time. Hidden in a firing position of made of sandbags, Hungarian machine gunners become nearly invincible to small arms, and gain significantly in firing accuracy and dispersion."}

		{"elite-mg(hun)" "A Soldiers armed with Solothurn 31M machine gun can provide excellent fire support to friendly infantry on assault. The Châtellerault's low magazine capacity is made up for by its high rate of fire and killing power. In addition, when mounted on special supports to fire from under cover or from a prone position, its accuracy and density of fire is greatly improved."}
		{"ap_miners(hun)" "Anti-personnel minefields are intended to deny enemy personnel entry to deployment sites and are mainly placed in front of established positions or on the flanks. A group of four mine-laying soldiers, armed with submachine guns, is capable of quick deployment of minefields, thereby securing unoccupied or strategically important sectors."}

For front-line operations, the squad is armed with submachine guns and can offer some resistance. Nevertheless, it is not recommended that these specialists be sent to attack fortified enemy positions."}
		{"snipers(hun)" "Using his rifle, a sniper can eliminate enemy personnel from a safe distance and the mounted telescopic sight allows him to spot even the best-hidden enemy saboteurs. Camouflage is the sniper's main weapon which is why, in addition to a telescope-sighted rifle, he carries a throwing knife and several camouflaging bushes."}
		{"officers(hun)" "The presence of a seasoned officer on the battlefield can change the course of battle. Using field binoculars, he can spot enemy infantry and saboteurs hiding in bushes or long grass. An officer can also spot an enemy from a long distance allowing time to regroup and react. As well as binoculars, he carries a knife and a personal handgun. However, these weapons are not suited to a heated battle."}
		{"at_rifles(hun)" "These anti-tank infantrymen is equipped with an anti-tank rifle, perfectly suited for taking out lightly armored enemy vehicles. While the high velocity rifle packs a punch, it is insufficient to take on heavier vehicles and it may require several shots to fully disable light vehicles."}
		{"flamers(hun)" "A soldier armed with a flame-thrower can inflict heavy damage on infantry inside a building and can single-handedly clear an entire area of enemies. In spite of this, he is extremely vulnerable because once he has used up all of his flammable liquid he remains unarmed and a random bullet can cause an explosion if it hits his cylinder. Accordingly, a combat unit includes several escort submachine gunners."}

Most variants were open-topped and had a single access door in the rear.

It was built on the Panzerkampfwagen 38(t)'s widened and lengthened chassis with modified suspension (larger road-wheels from Praga TNH n.A prototype reconnaissance tank) and up-rated engine. The new engine was 160 PS Praga AC/2 6-cylinder engine controlled by Praga-Wilson gearbox (5 forward and 1 reverse gear). The chassis was modified in order to accommodate a larger gun and thicker armour than the regular Panzerkampfwagen 38(t) tank.

The sIG 33 was rather heavy for its mission and it was redesigned in the late 1930s to incorporate light alloys in an effort to save weight. This saved about 150 kilograms (330 lb), but the outbreak of war forced the return to the original design before more than a few hundred were made, as the Luftwaffe had a higher priority for light alloys. A new carriage, made entirely of light alloys, was tested around 1939, but was not accepted for service."}
