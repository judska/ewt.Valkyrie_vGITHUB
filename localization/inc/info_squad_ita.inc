The most powerful and dangerous vehicle will become a pile of scrap metal if there's no crew to control it. When training a tank crew, interchangeability of all members is the key, because the tank must remain combat-ready, even if only one crew member survives. \n Although Italian tank crews are armed with government-issue weapons, they have no combat training and hence are extremely vulnerable."}
